#+TITLE: Bruno Jacquet's Emacs configuration
#+AUTHOR: Bruno Jacquet
#+STARTUP: showeverything
#+TOC: true

This is my personal config. My Emacs configuration used to span across multiple
files, one per major mode. My goal on this literate programming attempt is to
make the configuration more easier to search, and change; remove unecessary
logic; cleanup unused packages; and speedup loading time.

* Setup

** Package sources

** Packages to be installed

List all packages to install regardless of the system we are at. Additional package configuration is defined further down in this file.
