Patches to the Emacs-Lisp interface are whole-file replacements for
files you have in your <Allegro directory>/eli/ directory.

The files currently available:

fi-subproc.el, fi-subproc.elc
   Add `.' to the prompt regexp so prompts can reliably be detected.

fi-lep.el, fi-lep.elc
   Fix errors during symbol completion due to fontification in emacs buffers.
