;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; The code in this file has been influenced by three other
;;; interfaces between Gnu Emacs and a Common Lisp (CL) subprocess.
;;; The first was written by Leigh Stoller and Robert Kessler of the
;;; University of Utah for running HPCL or PCLS on HP Bobcats.  It is
;;; HP-specific and somewhat limited in functionality.  The second
;;; comes with Franz's Allegro CL.  This one is a fairly hairy set of
;;; low-level extensions which set up multiple communication streams
;;; (Unix TCP sockets) between Emacs and Allegro CL.  The third was
;;; developed at Thinking Machines Corporation for use with Lucid
;;; Common Lisp on SUN machines, and is designed to simulate the
;;; Symbolics lispm environment.  It is large and is quite
;;; Lucid-dependent.

;;; This code provides a simple portable interface between Emacs and
;;; CL which allows CL to send messages to Emacs without the use of
;;; (non-Common-Lisp) multiple processes or special stream
;;; connections.  We view the standard output stream as a
;;; concatenation of non-nested special-purpose streams.  Emacs
;;; separates out the various substreams and treats them accordingly.
;;; In this sense, it achieves most of the functionality of the Franz
;;; code, without low-level modifications to Emacs.  We provide a
;;; mechanism for CL to send commands to Emacs, to display strings in
;;; the minibuffer or pop-up help buffers, or just to insert strings
;;; at the point.

;;; We also provide a set of functions which improve interaction with
;;; the lisp process when editing the *lisp* or lisp-mode buffers.
;;; These include direct (ie not through a temp file) evaluation and
;;; in-package compilation of forms from lisp-mode buffers with
;;; optional echo into the *lisp* buffer, type-ahead with multi-line
;;; editing and a history mechanism for the *lisp* buffer, and pop-up
;;; help facilities for the CL functions documentation, macroexpand
;;; and describe.  There is an additional file of extensions for Lucid
;;; Common Lisp which provide pop-up arglists and source file editing,
;;; including a sort of buffer menu to let the user choose from
;;; multiple definitions.  There are also extensions to do source
;;; files correctly (ie, let the user choose which method to edit) for
;;; FLAVORS, CLOS, or PCL.

;;; This code should be compatible with any implementation of Common
;;; Lisp -- the extensions for Lucid, FLAVORS, CLOS and PCL are only
;;; loaded (automatically) if these features are present in your CL
;;; environment -- and it requires no special code to be loaded into
;;; the CL environment.  CL can tell that this code is loaded by
;;; looking at the value of the global variable user::*emacs-cl-shell*
;;; which is set by run-cl.  See comments below (in the CL output
;;; filter section) on how to talk to Emacs from CL.  You should be
;;; aware that when you start up lisp, Emacs tells the CL process to
;;; define the macro user::compile-def for use in compiling top-level
;;; forms.

;;; To use this code, you should either copy this file and the files
;;; shell-history.el, cl-lucid.el, cl-clos.el, cl-pcl.el and
;;; cl-flavors.el into your main emacs/lisp directory, or add the
;;; directory containing these files to the Emacs variable load-path.
;;; Put the following lines in your .emacs file:

;;;   (setq load-path (cons "<directory-containing-this-file>" load-path))
;;;   (setq *cl-program* <pathname-of-lisp-executable>)  ;default is "lisp"
;;;   (autoload 'run-cl "<pathname-of-this-file>" "" t) 

;;; You may also need the following (defaults are correct for Lucid's ">" prompt):

;;;   (setq *cl-prompt* <emacs-regexp-for-prompt>)
;;;   (setq *cl-error-prompt* <emacs-regexp-for-error-prompt)

;;; To run lisp, type "M-x run-cl" in emacs.  Lisp will start up in a
;;; buffer called *lisp*, and after it comes up, a set of blank
;;; prompts will appear.  This is normal and occurs because emacs is
;;; sending initialization commands to the lisp process.  Lisp images
;;; other than the default one bound to the variable *cl-program* may
;;; be specified interactively by using a prefix arg.  You can get
;;; help on key bindings and a brief page of documentation by doing
;;; "C-h f cl-shell-mode". The files cl-lucid.el, cl-clos.el
;;; cl-pcl.el, and/or cl-flavors.el will be loaded automatically if
;;; the corresponding features are present in your lisp environment,
;;; but these files are not necessary for the code in this file to
;;; work.  If you want to add more key bindings, define a function
;;; called cl-shell-hook to do this.  Only bindings that everyone
;;; agrees on should be put in this file!

;;; NOTE: Known bugs or questionable behaviors are described in the
;;; file "cl-buglist", and are marked in this file and in the
;;; accompanying files with the string "***".

;;; (see shell-mode) since some inferior-lisp-mode-map bindings rely

;;; interaction mode (inferior-lisp-mode).
(defun cl-shell-mode (&optional dont-run-hooks)
  "Major mode for interacting with a Common Lisp process.  This mode
should be entered using the command run-cl, which runs a Lisp 
interpreter as a subprocess of Emacs, with Lisp I/O through a buffer
named *lisp*.  Run-cl takes an optional argument which defaults to the
value of the variable *cl-program*.  
Variable *cl-pop-up* determines whether the *lisp* buffer pops up on
output from the CL process.
Variable *cl-echo-commands* determines whether commands being sent to
Common Lisp are echoed in the *lisp* buffer. 
Variable *cl-confirm-input* determines whether carriage returns in middle
of *lisp* buffer send the preceding S-expression directly to CL or
require a second carriage-return.
Variable *cl-replacement-prompt* determines whether the CL prompts
should be replaced. 
Variables *cl-prompt* and *cl-error-prompt* should be customized for
the specific implementation of Common Lisp.  The defaults are correct
for Lucid.

Commands:
Return at end of the *lisp* buffer sends line as input.
Return not at end sends the top-level sexp starting at or before the
cursor.  
C-M-a goes to previous top-level form (as in lisp-mode buffers),
and C-a respects the listener prompt. 
The following commands are provided from within the *lisp* buffer:
In general, the C-c C-<char> commands do not change the state of the 
CL environment, and the C-c <char> do.
\\{cl-shell-mode-map}
Most of the C-c commands are also provided in lisp-mode buffers.  In
addition, the following bindings are added to lisp-mode buffers for
sending things to the CL process:

C-c e           cl-eval-form
C-c r           cl-eval-region
C-c c           cl-compile-form
C-c l           cl-load-file
C-c x           cl-compile-file

;;; Similar to shell-send-input in shell.el, this function is called
;;; when the user types a newline in the interactive buffer.  The
;;; process-mark points to the place where CL inserts its output, or
;;; the end of the last input that was sent to CL (if output has not
;;; yet been received).  It is pushed forward when output is received
;;; from CL (see cl-filter).  Expressions sent to CL using
;;; cl-send-string-with-echo are echoed at this point.  If
;;; cl-shell-send-input is called with the point beyond the
;;; process-mark, it sends everything between process-mark and
;;; point-max (end of buffer) to the Lisp process, as long as there is
;;; at least one s-expression in that region and all sexps are
;;; complete.  [*** Might be better to send all complete sexp's and
;;; set process mark after the last one].  If any sexps are not not
;;; complete, then nothing is sent, but a newline is inserted at the
;;; point.  If cl-shell-send-input is called with the point before the
;;; process-mark, we copy the previous top-level sexp to the end of
;;; the buffer, and send it to CL.  If the sexp is not complete, it
;;; just beeps [*** Would be nice if return in middle of buffer

;;; (as if the user had typed it), the message-stream marker inserts
;;; the string into the minibuffer, the help-stream inserts the string
;;; into a pop-up help buffer, and the eval stream causes Emacs to
;;; read from the string and eval the result.  You should make an
;;; effort to ensure that the stream markers are sent un-interrupted.
;;; Example usage:
