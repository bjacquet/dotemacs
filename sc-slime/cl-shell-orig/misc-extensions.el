;;;; This is a file of useful miscellaneous extensions to emacs.
;;;; NOTE: it does not bind any keys -- it only provides function
;;;; definitions.  To use it, you should put lines into your .emacs
;;;; file which will load the file and then setup the desired
;;;; keybindings.  See the file example.emacs.

;;;; ---------------- Miscellaneous Command definitions -----------------

;;; Nice little function which rebinds keys which call old-function to
;;; call new-function.
