Introduction
------------

This is the Emacs setup I use both at home and at work. Feel free to use it,
modify it and share alike.

Most of its setup is towards Lisp and Orgmode files. A random colour theme is
used in each run, mostly dark themes (non-white backgrounds).

I'm running this setup in both Linux and Windows environments without any
obscure tweaks. Should work in other environments too.
